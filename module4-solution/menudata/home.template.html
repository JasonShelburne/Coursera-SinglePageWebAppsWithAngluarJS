<!--When the user goes to `/` path in your application, a home screen should be shown. It's up to you what you place on the home screen. You can just say "Welcome to our Restaurant". The home screen should have a link to a list of categories of menu items in the restaurant. Clicking that link would obviously take the user to the `/categories` view.-->
<title>Welcome to our Restaurant</title>
<a ui-sref="categories">List of Category of Menu Item</a>
